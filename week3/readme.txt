Week 3
In this week, we studied about quantum Fourier transform. Discrete Fourier transform takes an input of a vector of complex numbers and outputs the transformed data. Quantum Fourier transform is exactly the same transformation just the conventional notation for the quantum Fourier transform is different. The quantum Fourier transform transforms an orthonormal basis and is defined to be a linear operator acting on the basis states. This transformation is a unitary transformation and thus can be implemented as the dynamics of a quantum computer. Later, we described a quantum circuit for applying the Fourier transform on qubits. After this, we formed a circuit for quantum phase estimation. Given a unitary operator U with an eigenvector and its given eigenvalue. The goal of quantum phase estimation is to estimate phi. The phase estimation algorithm is not a complete algorithm as it requires the use of black boxes. Later we formed a circuit for quantum phase estimation.


After this, we studied about the famous quantum search Groverâ€™s algorithm which enables the search method to speed up exponentially. In that, an oracle was assumed which gave the value 1 if the input was a solution to a quantum search algorithm and the output was 0 if the solution was not a solution to the algorithm. Thus, the oracle is a unitary operator. The quantum search algorithm consists of repeated application of a quantum subroutine known as Grover iteration or Grover operator. Later, we studied how the Grover circuit is applied and how its performance is evaluated.
