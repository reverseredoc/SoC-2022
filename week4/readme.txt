WEEK 4
This week we studied about machine learning . Firstly, we studied about linear
regression. Linear regression is used to predict the values of independent
variable based on dependent variables. Then we studied about logistic
regression. Logistic regression is used to predict the values of dependent
variable based on independent variable when the dependent variable can only
tale discrete values unlike in linear regression where the dependent variable
has a continuous distribution. Then we studied about K-means clustering which
is an example of unsupervised learning that aims to partition n observations
into k clusters. After this, we studied about kernels and its properties and also
support vector machines. Lastly, we studied about neural networks which
consist of an interconnected group of nodes and convolutional neural
networks which consist of convolutional layer to extract abstract features.
We studied about all these topics and implemented them in jupyter notebook
using libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit, TensorFlow and keras
