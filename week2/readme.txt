Week 2

Summary

In this week, we studied about quantum circuits in detail and also implemented some of the
algorithms on qiskit. This weel was application intensive.
We started by revisiting single qubit operations and Bloch sphere representation of matrices. Then, I
studied about rotation matrices that were obtained by exponentiating Pauli matrices This chapter
was supplemented by a lot of computation intensive and non trivial problems and I found some of
them quite challenging Then came the important result that any Hermitian matrix can be
represented as a product of global phase and rotation matrices. Also, another general
representation of any matrix as rotation about a particular axis n cap by angle that was studied.
Then I personally studied about various properties of a unitary matrix, how each can be represented
as e exponentiated to a Hermitian matrix etc. Then another representation was introduced in which
any unitary matrix can be presented as a products of global space, X gates and single qubit gates,
Thus any quantum gate could be broken down to a product of a global phase and single qubit gates
Then, I solved all of the problems which aimed to represent / decompose Hadamard gate to each of
these decompositions.

Then, controlled qubit operations were reintroduced. Density operator was introduced in a problem
and thus I studied about density operator and their propertied for both pure and mixed states.
Then using the above decomposition theorems, we studied about a lot of circuits involving them.
After that , I studied about the two important principles of measurements and another prototype for
the teleportation circuit which I also implemented in qiskit.
After this I studied about how every unitary matrix can be decomposed and implemented with the
help of only CNOT, phase and Hadamard gate to an arbitrary accuracy.
This was followed by implementation exercises in qiskit. I installed the prerequisites from their
official site and learnt the basic syntax of qiskit by reading all of the pages on it till Section 3.
Thereafter, I implemented all of the mandatory problems and displayed their Bloch spheres, state
vectors, quantum circuits etc for seeing the output and for verification.
